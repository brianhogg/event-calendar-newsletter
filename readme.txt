**How it works**

Event Calendar Newsletter automatically pulls event details from the WordPress event calendar plugin you have installed on your site and generates a newsletter-friendly layout based on the specific event details you want to include.

If you have a WordPress event calendar installed on your website, you can begin using Event Calendar Newsletter right away. If you don’t have a WordPress event calendar, install one! You can use one of five free plugins (see below, [more in Pro](https://eventcalendarnewsletter.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=event-cal-readme&utm_content=description)).
